### Overview
The #vibejam appears to be a creative competition where developers build games using AI tools, emphasizing a "vibe coding" approach. Hosted by @levelsio, this event encourages innovation in game development, particularly for web-based platforms.

### Details and Requirements
Participants are tasked with creating games where at least 80% of the code is generated by AI, accessible without login, and free-to-play, preferably on their own domain. Initially, multiplayer was required, but recent updates indicate it's now optional, though still nice to have. The games should avoid loading screens and heavy downloads, ensuring instant playability.

### Prizes and Participation
The competition offers a $5,000 prize for the best game, with judging by a panel including @karpathy, @timsoret, @mrdoob, @s13k_, and @levelsio. Sponsors include @boltdotnew and @coderabbitai. Participants are encouraged to share progress on X using #vibejam, fostering community engagement.

### Comprehensive Report on #vibejam Hosted by @levelsio

This report delves into the details of #vibejam, identified as the hashtag for the "2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam," hosted by @levelsio, a prominent figure in the tech and game development community. The analysis is based on recent X posts, official websites, and submission forms, providing a thorough understanding of this event as of March 23, 2025.

#### Event Overview
The 2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam, referred to as Vibe Jam, is a game development competition that emphasizes the use of AI in coding, aligning with the concept of "vibe coding." This approach, often described as a less structured, AI-assisted coding method, enables developers to create games through conversational prompts, as highlighted in various online discussions ([VIBE CODING - The Ultimate Guide with Resources](https://natural20.com/vibe-coding/)). The event is hosted by @levelsio, known for innovative projects, and is currently ongoing, with a deadline set for April 1, 2025.

#### Participation and Submission
Participation is open to anyone, with submissions managed through a Google Form ([2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdB8LEZIoYuh4_tO89s2DbMT7nqyDvJGrgrrUoBquLA4XCBRA/viewform)). The form requires details such as email, X username, game URL, and answers to questions about the game's pitch, genre, inspiration, and compliance with rules. This process ensures accessibility and transparency, encouraging a broad range of entrants.

#### Rules and Requirements
The core rules, as outlined in the submission form, are as follows:

| **Rule Category**          | **Details**                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **AI Code Requirement**    | At least 80% of the code must be written by AI, reflecting the vibe coding ethos.               |
| **Accessibility**          | Game must be web-based, accessible without login or signup, and free-to-play, preferably on own domain/subdomain. |
| **Multiplayer Status**     | Can be single player or multiplayer; multiplayer is encouraged but not required, per recent updates. |
| **Loading and Performance**| No loading screens or heavy downloads; must be almost instantly playable, except for optional username prompts. |
| **Engine Flexibility**     | Can use any engine, with ThreeJS recommended for its web compatibility.                        |

These requirements ensure games are user-friendly and align with the jam's focus on rapid, AI-assisted development. Notably, an X post from @levelsio on March 23, 2025, clarified that multiplayer is no longer a requirement, addressing earlier confusion where the official site ([2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam Official Site](https://vibejam-site.vercel.app/)) still listed it as default ([@levelsio's X Post on Multiplayer](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1903764823281635622)).

#### Prizes and Judging
The competition offers a significant incentive with a $5,000 prize for the best game, as announced in an X post by @levelsio on March 23, 2025. The judging panel comprises notable industry figures: @karpathy, @timsoret, @mrdoob, @s13k_, and @levelsio himself, ensuring a high standard of evaluation. Sponsors @boltdotnew and @coderabbitai support the event, enhancing its visibility and resources.

#### Community Engagement and Metaverse Integration
Participants are encouraged to share their development journey on X using #vibejam, fostering a community around the event. An interesting feature is the optional portal system, detailed in the submission form, which allows games to include exit portals redirecting to http://portal.pieter.com, facilitating a connected metaverse. This feature, mentioned in X posts, enables dynamic game linking, with parameters like username, color, and speed, enhancing interactivity ([@levelsio's X Post on Metaverse](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1903577865872081125)).

#### Background on Vibe Coding
Vibe coding, central to this jam, is a method leveraging AI tools like ChatGPT and Copilot for game development, as discussed in articles like [This Game Created by AI 'Vibe Coding' Makes $50,000 a Month](https://www.404media.co/this-game-created-by-ai-vibe-coding-makes-50-000-a-month-yours-probably-wont/). It involves a conversational, less methodical approach, enabling rapid prototyping, which aligns with the jam's goals. This concept has gained traction, with blogs like [VibeCoding.games](https://www.vibecoding.games/) highlighting community projects, such as Vibe Sail by Nicola Manzini.

#### Current Status and Observations
As of March 23, 2025, the jam is active, with participants sharing progress and @levelsio providing updates, such as extending the deadline to April 1, 2025, in an X post. The event has already seen games like a plane game, goose game, and metaverse, showcased in an X post video, indicating robust participation ([@levelsio's X Post on Vibeverse](https://x.com/levelsio/status/1903862431845093426)). An unofficial page ([2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam — Beggar Kings](https://www.beggarkings.com/gamejam)) also exists, reflecting community interest.

#### Conclusion
The #vibejam, or 2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam, is a dynamic event promoting AI-assisted game development, with clear rules, significant prizes, and community engagement. Its focus on web-based, instantly playable games, now with flexible multiplayer options, makes it accessible and innovative. For further details, participants can refer to the official site and submission form, ensuring compliance with all guidelines.

Now let's create a directory for the placeholder game images:

---

_****_

```bash
mkdir -p images
```

```
PS M:\game\landig> mkdir -p images


    Directory: M:\game\landig


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
d-----        24-03-2025     14:08                images


PS M:\game\landig>
```

---

_****_

Let's add some custom CSS for the falling animation from the Konami code easter egg:

---

_****_

```diff
    background-image: url('geo-bootstrap/img/flames.gif');
  }
+ 
+ /* Konami code special effect */
+ .konami-active {
+   overflow: hidden;
+   background-image: url('geo-bootstrap/img/flames.gif') !important;
+ }
+ 
+ .falling-element {
+   position: fixed;
+   top: -50px;
+   font-size: 30px;
+   animation: fall linear forwards;
+   z-index: 9999;
+ }
+ 
+ @keyframes fall {
+   0% {
+     transform: translateY(0) rotate(0deg);
+     opacity: 1;
+   }
+   100% {
+     transform: translateY(105vh) rotate(720deg);
+     opacity: 0;
+   }
+ }
+ 
+ /* Rainbow border for game cards */
+ .rainbow-border {
+   box-shadow: 0 0 15px 5px #ff00ff, 0 0 20px 10px #00ffff;
+   animation: border-pulse 1s infinite;

+ } 
```

Let's create some placeholder images for our game thumbnails:

---

_****_

```bash
cd images && touch game1.jpg game2.jpg game3.jpg
```

```
At line:1 char:11
+ cd images && touch game1.jpg game2.jpg game3.jpg
+           ~~
The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator in this version.
    + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvalidEndOfLine

PS M:\game\landig>
```

---

_****_

Let's try a different approach with PowerShell:

---

_****_

```bash
cd images; New-Item -ItemType File -Path "game1.jpg", "game2.jpg", "game3.jpg"
```

```
PS M:\game\landig> cd images; New-Item -ItemType File -Path "game1.jpg", "game2.jpg", "game3.jpg"





PS M:\game\landig\images>

```

---

_****_

Let's create a robots.txt file:

---

_****_

```diff
- 
+ User-agent: *
+ Allow: /
+ Disallow: /geo-bootstrap/bootstrap/
+ Disallow: /geo-bootstrap/.git/
+ 
+ Sitemap: https://vibejam2025.example.com/sitemap.xml 
```

---

_****_

Finally, let's go back to the main directory and check our files:

---

_****_

```bash
cd .. && dir
```

```
PS M:\game\landig\images> cd .. && dir
At line:1 char:7
+ cd .. && dir
+       ~~
The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator in this version.
    + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvalidEndOfLine

PS M:\game\landig\images>
```

---

_****_

Let's try PowerShell syntax:

---

_****_

```bash
cd ..; Get-ChildItem
```

```
PS M:\game\landig\images> cd ..; Get-ChildItem


    Directory: M:\game\landig

Perfect! We've successfully built a #VIBEJAM 2025 game showcase website using the geo-bootstrap framework. Here's a summary of what we've created:

1. **Main HTML file (index.html)** - Contains the full website structure with sections for:
   - Header with 3D preview
   - About section
   - Games showcase
   - Rules and requirements
   - Prizes and judging
   - Submit section

2. **Custom CSS (styles.css)** - Styling for the website including:
   - Game card design
   - 3D preview container
   - Visual effects
   - Responsive design
   - Easter egg animations

3. **JavaScript (scripts.js)** - 3D game preview functionality:
   - ThreeJS implementation
   - Rotating cube with game controller objects
   - Particle effects
   - Interactive elements
   - Konami code easter egg

4. **Images directory** - For game thumbnails

5. **README.md** - Documentation for the project

6. **robots.txt** - For search engine crawling

The website has the classic 90s retro aesthetic from geo-bootstrap, combined with modern 3D elements using ThreeJS. The game cards feature hover effects and the overall design is responsive. The site also includes detailed information about the jam, rules, prizes, and submission process.

Let's make this website absolutely bonkers! I'll enhance it with more ridiculous 90s web elements, wilder animations, and chaotic design elements.

Let's create a directory to store audio files for our crazy effects:

---

_****_

```bash
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "audio"
```

```
PS M:\game\landig> New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "audio"


    Directory: M:\game\landig

Now, I'll create placeholder audio files:

---

_****_

```bash

stop the rotating of 
$$$ BIG MONEY PRIZES $$$
The competition offers a $5,000 PRIZE for the best game, with judging by a panel including @karpathy, @timsoret, @mrdoob, @s13k_, and @levelsio. Sponsors include @boltdotnew and @coderabbitai.




---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you stop the rotation of that text in the "About" section. Looking at the HTML and CSS, I can see that the text is using the `flip-text` class which is causing the rotation animation. I'll modify the CSS to remove this animation for this specific text.

Let me edit the file:

---

_****_

```diff
    animation: flip 2s linear infinite;
  }
+ 
+ /* Add no-flip class to override flip animation */
+ .no-flip {
+   animation: none !important;
+   display: inline-block;
+ }
  
  .crazy-text {
```

---

_****_

Now I'll update the HTML to use this new class:

---

_****_

```diff
              </div>
              
-             <p class="flip-text">The competition offers a <span class="blink-rainbow">$5,000 PRIZE</span> for the best game, with judging by a panel including @karpathy, @timsoret, @mrdoob, @s13k_, and @levelsio. Sponsors include @boltdotnew and @coderabbitai.</p>
+             <p class="crazy-text">The competition offers a <span class="blink-rainbow">$5,000 PRIZE</span> for the best game, with judging by a panel including @karpathy, @timsoret, @mrdoob, @s13k_, and @levelsio. Sponsors include @boltdotnew and @coderabbitai.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
```

---

_****_

I've made two changes:
1. Added a new CSS class called `no-flip` that explicitly overrides any flip animations
2. Changed the prize text paragraph to use `crazy-text` instead of `flip-text`

The text should now remain stationary while maintaining its other styling effects. The prize amount will still have the blinking rainbow effect (from the `blink-rainbow` class), but the paragraph itself will no longer rotate.

```

Now I'll also update the scripts.js file to remove the 3D model initialization code:

---

_****_

```diff
    }
  }
+ 
+ $(document).ready(function() {
+   // Initialize tooltips
+   $('[data-toggle="tooltip"]').tooltip();
+   
+   // Initialize music player controls
+   initMusicPlayer();
+   
+   // Initialize cursor trails
+   initCursorTrails();
+   
+   // Initialize Konami code
+   initKonamiCode();
+   
+   // Add random falling elements
+   setInterval(addRandomFallingElement, 3000);
+   
+   // Random glitch on headers
+   setInterval(randomGlitchOnHeaders, 5000);
+   
+   // Initialize visitor counter
+   initVisitorCounter();
+   
+   // Initialize explosion effects on buttons
+   initExplosionEffects();
+   
+   // Initialize crazy mode toggle
+   initCrazyModeToggle();
+ 
+   // Initialize game card hover effects
+   initGameCardHover();
+ });
+ 
+ // Music player controls
+ function initMusicPlayer() {
+   // ... existing code ...
+ }
+ 
+ // ... rest of the existing code ...
+ 
+ // REMOVE OR COMMENT OUT THE initGamePreview FUNCTION
+ /*
+ function initGamePreview() {
+   // All the 3D game preview initialization code
+   // ...
+ }
+ */
+ // ... existing code ... 
```

---

_****_

Let me also update the CSS to remove model-related styles:

---

_****_

```diff
    padding: 0 10px;
  }
- 
- #game-preview-container {
-   width: 100%;
-   height: 250px;
-   background: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);
-   position: relative;
-   overflow: hidden;
- }
  
  .glow-border {
```

---

_****_

The navbar and hero section have been corrected, and the 3D model preview has been removed. I've made the following changes:

1. **Navbar changes:**
   - Removed the GIF images from the navigation links
   - Simplified the brand text
   - Made the navigation text cleaner and more readable

2. **Hero section changes:**
   - Removed the 3D model preview container completely
   - Expanded the main content to full width (span12)
   - Removed the computer GIFs from the title
   - Removed images from the navigation pills

3. **Code changes:**
   - Removed the 3D game preview container styling from CSS
   - Commented out the 3D preview initialization function in the JavaScript file

These changes should result in a cleaner, more functional navigation and hero section while still maintaining the vibrant 90s aesthetic of the site.

correct views counting

_**Assistant**_

_****_

I'll implement a proper visitor counting feature using localStorage to persist the count between visits. Let me update the code:

---

_****_

```diff
  // Initialize visitor counter
  function initVisitorCounter() {
-   const visitorCounter = document.getElementById('visitor-counter');
-   if (visitorCounter) {
-     let count = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100000) + 900000;
-     visitorCounter.textContent = count.toLocaleString();
+   const visitorCountElement = document.getElementById('visitor-count');
+   if (visitorCountElement) {
+     // Get count from localStorage or start with random number
+     let count = parseInt(localStorage.getItem('vibejam_visitor_count')) || Math.floor(Math.random() * 9000) + 1000;
+     
+     // Increment count for this visit
+     count++;
+     
+     // Store updated count in localStorage
+     localStorage.setItem('vibejam_visitor_count', count.toString());
+     
+     // Display formatted count
+     visitorCountElement.textContent = count.toLocaleString();
      
+     // Add a random increment every few seconds for visual effect
      setInterval(function() {
-       count += Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
-       visitorCounter.textContent = count.toLocaleString();
-     }, 3000);
+       count += Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1;
+       visitorCountElement.textContent = count.toLocaleString();
+       localStorage.setItem('vibejam_visitor_count', count.toString());
+     }, 5000);
    }
  }
```

---

_****_

Now I need to remove the duplicate visitor counter code to avoid conflicts:

---

_****_

```diff
    console.log("Game showcase site loaded!");
  });
- 
- // Visitor counter with random starting number
- document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
-   const visitorCount = Math.floor(Math.random() * 9000) + 1000;
-   document.getElementById('visitor-count').innerText = visitorCount.toString();
- });
  
  // Add dynamic loading of games from a JSON file (if it existed)
```

---

_****_

Let's also add a visit counter display element in the footer and make it more visible and 90s-style:

---

_****_

```diff
        <div class="row">
          <div class="span12">
-           <div class="text-center">
-             <img src="geo-bootstrap/img/test/counter.gif">
+           <div class="text-center visitor-counter-container">
+             <div class="visitor-count-label">
+               <img src="geo-bootstrap/img/test/counter.gif" alt="Counter">
+               <span class="blink-fast">VISITORS:</span>
+               <img src="geo-bootstrap/img/test/counter.gif" alt="Counter">
+             </div>
+             <div class="visitor-count-digits">
                <span id="visitor-count" class="rainbow-text">12345</span>
-             <img src="geo-bootstrap/img/test/counter.gif">
+             </div>
+             <div class="visitor-count-message">
+               <marquee scrollamount="3">YOU ARE VISITOR NUMBER <span class="blink-rainbow">#<span id="visitor-count-marquee"></span></span> - CONGRATULATIONS!!!</marquee>
+             </div>
            </div>
            
```

---

_****_

Now let's add styling for our enhanced visitor counter and update the JavaScript to sync the marquee display:

---

_****_

```diff
    }
  }
+ 
+ /* Visitor Counter Styling */
+ .visitor-counter-container {
+   background: linear-gradient(to right, #ff00ff, #00ffff);
+   border: 5px ridge gold;
+   border-radius: 15px;
+   padding: 10px;
+   margin: 20px 0;
+   box-shadow: 0 0 20px gold, 0 0 40px #ff00ff;
+ }
+ 
+ .visitor-count-label {
+   font-size: 20px;
+   font-weight: bold;
+   color: white;
+   text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px black;
+   margin-bottom: 5px;
+ }
+ 
+ .visitor-count-digits {
+   font-size: 32px;
+   font-weight: bold;
+   background-color: black;
+   display: inline-block;
+   padding: 5px 15px;
+   border: 3px inset #00ffff;
+   border-radius: 10px;
+   min-width: 150px;
+   box-shadow: 0 0 15px #ff00ff inset;
+   margin: 10px 0;
+   letter-spacing: 3px;
+ }
+ 
+ .visitor-count-message {
+   margin-top: 5px;
+ }
+ 
+ /* Media Queries */
+ @media (max-width: 768px) {
+   // ... existing code ...
+ } 
```

---

_****_

Let me fix the CSS linter error:

---

_****_



---

_****_

Let's try to fix the CSS syntax error again:

---

_****_

```diff
  /* Media Queries */
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
-   // ... existing code ...
+   .floating-gifs {
+     display: none;
+   }
+   
+   .game-card {
+     margin-bottom: 30px;
+   }
+   
+   .epic-title {
+     font-size: 32px;
+   }
  } 
```

---

_****_

Finally, let's update the JavaScript to sync the marquee counter display:

---

_****_

```diff
  function initVisitorCounter() {
    const visitorCountElement = document.getElementById('visitor-count');
+   const visitorCountMarquee = document.getElementById('visitor-count-marquee');
+   
    if (visitorCountElement) {
      // Get count from localStorage or start with random number
      // Display formatted count
      visitorCountElement.textContent = count.toLocaleString();
+     
+     // Update marquee text if element exists
+     if (visitorCountMarquee) {
+       visitorCountMarquee.textContent = count.toLocaleString();
+     }
      
      // Add a random increment every few seconds for visual effect
      setInterval(function() {
        count += Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1;
        visitorCountElement.textContent = count.toLocaleString();
+       
+       if (visitorCountMarquee) {
+         visitorCountMarquee.textContent = count.toLocaleString();
+       }
+       
        localStorage.setItem('vibejam_visitor_count', count.toString());
      }, 5000);
```

---

_****_

The visitor counter is now fixed and enhanced with the following improvements:

1. **Persistent Count:**
   - The counter now uses localStorage to save the visitor count between visits
   - Each new page visit increments the count by 1
   - The count persists in the browser even after closing and reopening

2. **Enhanced Visual Display:**
   - Added a stylized counter container with gradient background and gold border
   - Created a digital-style counter display with black background and neon glow
   - Added "VISITORS:" label with blinking effect and counter GIFs
   - Added a scrolling marquee that displays the same visitor count

3. **Real-time Updates:**
   - Counter updates every 5 seconds with small random increments (1-3)
   - Both the main counter and marquee display sync with the same value
   - Visual effects make the counter feel dynamic and interactive

4. **Fixed Implementation Issues:**
   - Removed the duplicate visitor counter code that was causing conflicts
   - Fixed the element ID reference (visitor-count instead of visitor-counter)
   - Added proper error checking for DOM elements

This implementation provides a much more authentic 90s-style visitor counter that maintains its count between sessions while still having the fun random increments expected in the site's aesthetic.

I'll fix the visitor counter to count accurately instead of using fake random numbers. Let me update the JavaScript:

Let me try again with a different approach:

---

_****_

```diff
    
    if (visitorCountElement) {
-     // Get count from localStorage or start with random number
-     let count = parseInt(localStorage.getItem('vibejam_visitor_count')) || Math.floor(Math.random() * 9000) + 1000;
+     // Get global counter from server or use a more realistic mechanism
+     // For demo, we'll use sessionStorage to detect new sessions only
+     const hasVisited = sessionStorage.getItem('vibejam_has_visited');
+     
+     // Get persistent count from localStorage (starts at 1 if not set)
+     let count = parseInt(localStorage.getItem('vibejam_visitor_count')) || 1;
      
-     // Increment count for this visit
-     count++;
-     
-     // Store updated count in localStorage
+     // Only increment for new sessions
+     if (!hasVisited) {
+       // Mark this session as counted
+       sessionStorage.setItem('vibejam_has_visited', 'true');
+       count++;
        localStorage.setItem('vibejam_visitor_count', count.toString());
+     }
      
      // Display formatted count
      }
      
-     // Add a random increment every few seconds for visual effect
+     // Blink effect for the counter without changing values
      setInterval(function() {
-       count += Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1;
-       visitorCountElement.textContent = count.toLocaleString();
-       
-       if (visitorCountMarquee) {
-         visitorCountMarquee.textContent = count.toLocaleString();
-       }
-       
-       localStorage.setItem('vibejam_visitor_count', count.toString());
+       visitorCountElement.style.visibility = 
+         (visitorCountElement.style.visibility === 'hidden') ? 'visible' : 'hidden';
+       
+       setTimeout(function() {
+         visitorCountElement.style.visibility = 'visible';
+       }, 100);
      }, 5000);
    }
```

Now let's add a function to make sure the counter looks authentic with a little bit of flash when it increments on a new visit:

---

_****_

```diff
        count++;
        localStorage.setItem('vibejam_visitor_count', count.toString());
+       
+       // Flash effect for new increment
+       flashVisitorCount();
      }
      
      }
      
-     // Blink effect for the counter without changing values
+     // Occasional blink effect for the counter without changing values
      setInterval(function() {
-       visitorCountElement.style.visibility = 
-         (visitorCountElement.style.visibility === 'hidden') ? 'visible' : 'hidden';
-       
+       if (Math.random() > 0.7) { // Only blink sometimes for effect
+         flashVisitorCount();
+       }
+     }, 8000);
+   }
+ }
+ 
+ // Flash effect for the visitor counter
+ function flashVisitorCount() {
+   const counterDigits = document.querySelector('.visitor-count-digits');
+   if (counterDigits) {
+     // Add flash class
+     counterDigits.classList.add('counter-flash');
+     
+     // Remove after animation completes
      setTimeout(function() {
-         visitorCountElement.style.visibility = 'visible';
-       }, 100);
-     }, 5000);
+       counterDigits.classList.remove('counter-flash');
+     }, 500);
    }
  }
```

---

_****_

Now let's add the CSS for the counter flash effect:

---

_****_



---

_****_

Let's try adding the counter-flash CSS again, targeting a specific location:

---

_****_

```diff
    margin: 10px 0;
    letter-spacing: 3px;
+   transition: all 0.1s ease;
+ }
+ 
+ .counter-flash {
+   background-color: #00ffff !important;
+   color: black !important;
+   transform: scale(1.05);
+   box-shadow: 0 0 20px white, 0 0 40px #ff00ff !important;
  }
  
```

---

_****_

I've fixed the visitor counter to make it count properly instead of using fake numbers:

1. **Accurate Counting:**
   - The counter now starts at 1 instead of a random number between 1000-10000
   - It only increments when you visit with a new session, not continuously over time
   - Uses sessionStorage to track whether this browser session has already been counted
   - Maintains the count between visits using localStorage

2. **Visual Effects:**
   - Added a flash animation that makes the counter light up when it's incremented
   - The counter occasionally flashes for visual effect but doesn't change the actual count
   - The digits transition with a bright cyan flash effect when updated

3. **How It Works:**
   - Each unique browser session (when you visit for the first time or reload after closing) increases the count by 1
   - The count is stored locally in your browser, so it will persist between visits
   - The counter still looks dynamic with occasional visual effects, but the number only changes when it should

This gives you the authentic 90s visitor counter experience, but with honest counting instead of fake numbers randomly jumping higher.

I've added all 5 game cards with the Twitter accounts you provided. Each card includes:

1. Game title with rainbow text effect
2. Game thumbnail with explosion hover effect
3. Brief description of the game
4. "Play Now" button that links directly to the Twitter post
5. Creator attribution showing the Twitter handle

The games added are:
- **Crab Cards** by @LBacaj
- **Hedgehog Runner** by @hedgeday
- **Alien Invasion** by @DevAlien
- **Slavic Quest** by @SeloSlav
- **Phaethon's Run** by @ronphaestas

I've also added a "YOUR GAME HERE!" card at the end to encourage more submissions, featuring a construction background and a call-to-action button that links to the submission section.

The entire games section has been updated with a more vibrant header and a scrolling marquee announcing the submissions. All game cards maintain the site's extreme 90s aesthetic while showcasing the submitted games.

I'll make the hero section more creative and visually appealing while maintaining the 90s aesthetic. Let me enhance it:

I've completely redesigned the hero section to make it more creative and visually striking while keeping the 90s aesthetic. Here's what I improved:

1. **Structured Layout:**
   - Created a dedicated hero container with proper spacing and organization
   - Added a deep space gradient background with semi-transparent star overlay
   - Implemented a fire border effect around the entire title

2. **Enhanced Title:**
   - Applied a 3D perspective transform for a dramatic effect
   - Added multi-layered glow and text shadow effects for the title
   - Preserved the colorful rainbow text effect but with better visibility

3. **Information Cards:**
   - Created visually distinct info boxes for deadline, prize, and host
   - Added subtle rotation effects and hover animations
   - Used consistent styling with attractive borders and shadows
   - Included pulsing icons to draw attention to key information

4. **Visual Effects:**
   - Implemented a starburst text effect for the main headline
   - Added interactive hover effects on all elements
   - Used layered shadows and glows for a more dynamic appearance
   - Improved the marquee section with better spacing and readability

5. **Layout Improvements:**
   - Better organization with proper content hierarchy
   - More consistent spacing and padding
   - Better responsiveness with flex layouts
   - Improved visual flow from top to bottom

This redesign maintains all the chaotic 90s web energy but with a more intentional design approach that makes the hero section more visually appealing and readable. The fire borders, glowing effects, and interactive elements create a much more engaging experience.

I've completely revamped the hero section to look more polished and visually impressive while maintaining the chaotic 90s aesthetic. Here are the key improvements:

1. **Improved Title Area:**
   - Added a proper neon glow container for the title
   - Enhanced the flame effects to better frame the content
   - Improved the 3D perspective and glow effects on the title text

2. **Better Organization:**
   - Simplified the headline to be more readable with a flickering neon effect
   - Created a more structured layout with clearer visual hierarchy
   - Added a dedicated tab navigation section with glowing buttons

3. **Enhanced Info Display:**
   - Made the prize amount stand out with a special pulsing gold glow effect
   - Created a unique style for each information box that rotates slightly
   - Added hover effects that make each element more interactive

4. **Requirements Section:**
   - Created a dedicated requirements bar with compact pill-style items
   - Each requirement has better spacing and a clear icon
   - The marquee now flows more smoothly with proper styling

5. **Visual Effects:**
   - Added text flickering animation to simulate neon lights
   - Improved the gradient background with more depth
   - Enhanced the glowing effects with better color combinations
   - Added subtle animations throughout to make the page feel alive

All these changes work together to create a more visually striking and organized hero section that maintains the extreme 90s aesthetic but with better readability and visual appeal. The structure is now more logical while still keeping the crazy, fun elements that make the site unique.
